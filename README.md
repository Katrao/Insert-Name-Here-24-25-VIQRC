2024-2025 Vex IQ Robotics Competition - Rapid Relay

Hello! We are Insert Name Here, a new team of 8th graders.
This repository is for all of our code, from our earliest drivetrain code to our latest autonomous program.
All of these files are either in .iqblocks or .iqpython format, and only for use with VEXcode IQ.
As we are still in season, we cannot share our notebook here yet, but it will come soon!

Thank you and have a great day!
